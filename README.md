# stonks-server
Centralized server for small game I'm working on. Based on the guts of another project, Pyserver, which is a small HTTP server written in Python.
Now, for what this server does, it sends out what's more or less a news feed to game clients, and that news feed contains some information on virtual stock prices, which players can use to make (somewhat) informed decisions on what to do in the game.

The key thing about this is that everyone's playing off the same information, on what's basically a mini-exchange for assets that don't exist. 
Finally, the server isn't meant to be anything big, it's meant to have the pure information sent out by the server, and it lets the client do all the fancy stuff. Anyways, I figure that's enough info-dumping. Try it out for yourself! (insert URL here later)
